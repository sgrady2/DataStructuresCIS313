pseudo for max

for i=0 to n-1
	if i > i+1
		max = i

Algorithm searchMax(Array, n(size))1
input:array and size of A     2
output:The single max element  3
current max = A[0]         4
for i = 1 to n-1     		5
if current < A[i]			6
current max = A[i]			7	
return current				8


Main differences in notation
-----------------------------
left arrow assigns things
equals sign is ==
Method delcaration is important
indentation on if else
while conditions true do actions, use indentation to indicate whats inside the whileloop
repeat actions until codition
for var inc do actions
object.method(args) is a correct method call
Method returns return vale is valid

Primitive Operations
--------------------
Assigning a value to a var
calling a method
performing an arithmatic operation
comparing 2 numbers
indexing into an array
following an object reference
returning from a method

Primitive means the operation corresponds to a low-level instruction with an execution time that depends on the hardware and software environment, but is NEVERTHELESS constant

method name

return

Big Oh-less than or equal to.
Big Omega-greater than or equal to
Big Thetta- Asymptotically equal up to a constant factor!
