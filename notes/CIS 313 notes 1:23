CIS 313 notes 1/23

Dont push null pointers!!

Life cycles of nodes, in preorder and inorder each node is visited 0,1 and 2 times 

Activation records or stack frames, using step counters to understand what phase were in (pseudocode)

always start traversals with Q.enque(T.root) S.push(T.root)

Level order (gen go left to right)

FORT
-------
Forrest of ordered trees
so its a collection of ordered trees

BST
===
Binary Search Tree ops
insert, delete, next, previous (uses tree order)
Delete
------
its easiest to delete an external node for obvious reasons

if its an internal node with one child... just readjust the parent of the deleted node to the child of the deleted node

for deleted a root, find a left successor and copy that value to the root

3 cases for deletion
0 just delete
1 splice
2
