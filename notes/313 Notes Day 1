313 Notes Day 1
Complexity measure
time(# of steps)
space(ie how steps affect memory)
bandwidth
disk access(disk io is slow compared to a chip cycle)

Pseudocode--no machine, simple high level language
Complexity of the program, worst and best case gives an average case
Complexity of the problem, such as sorting or bipartite matching

Bubblesort is O(n^2), giving its worst case as a 'default' case
Order of growth on comparisons given n elements and 
or order of magnitude

we are talking about the algorithm and not the hardware that might affect the complexity and timing of the overall situation

DEF


314 3 things
basic idea of signed and unsigned
if you compare signed and unsigned you get unexpected results
having all 1111 on a signed number is -1
IMPORTANT
--------
this holds for 2s compliment dealing with singed numbers

x+~x=-1

x+1=~x

Low effective address long leal-
C code
int mull2(int x){
	return x*12;
}
mults
leal (%eax, %eax, 2), %eax
sall $2, %eax
divs
shift right logic SRL
shrl $3, %eax

IEEE Standard Floating Point


ALWAYS use signed 


f(n) = O(g(n))

Notation
--------
O Means <=
big Omega means >=
big Theta means =
little omega w means >
little o means <
